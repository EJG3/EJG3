- I’m @EJG3
- I’m working on a project to convert a 1973 GMC Motorhome (like the "Urban Assault Vehicle" in Stripes) to an EV. 
- For the EV components for the project, I've purchased a salvage 2021 Mustang Mach E EV, took out all the EV drivetrain and reassembled it on a test stand in my garage.
- I'm modifying systems on the test stand before moving them over to the 1973 Motorhome.  Part of that is reverse-engineering the various modules on the EV's multiple CANBUS's.
- Right now, my main project is using an Arduino with a MPC2515 to "sniff" the EV Canbus to map out what I can change and create some new modules using Arduino (hopefully with integrated screen control) for the target vehicle.
